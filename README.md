# Set Proofing Language in One Note - Apple Script
Simple Apple Script to set desired proofing language in Microsoft One Note.

I do recommend to pair it with software like BetterTouchTool so the script can be invoked with a keystroke (in BetterTouchTool we can create new shortcut and do the action Run Apple Script where the contents of the script should be pasted)

## Set up the script
In script code, change '23', which is English UK, to desired row number of your language in the displayed Set Proofing Languages Window table.
